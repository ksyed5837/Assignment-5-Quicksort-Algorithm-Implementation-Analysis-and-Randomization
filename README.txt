This repository contains my implementation and analysis for Assignment 5.

## Files

- `quicksort.py  
  - Contains both the deterministic and randomized Quicksort implementations.
  - Includes timing/experiment code to compare performance on different input sizes and distributions.

- Quicksort_Report.docx  
  - Detailed report describing:
    - Algorithm design and implementation details
    - Time and space complexity analysis (best, average, worst case)
    - How randomization changes the expected performance
    - Discussion of the empirical results

- results.csv  
  - Timing data generated by running the algorithms on different input sizes and patterns.

- graph.png
  - Plot of the empirical running times from `results.csv`, comparing deterministic and randomized Quicksort.
